Gates are colossal human-made megastructures designed to stabilize and hold open [[Corridors]] for reliable interstellar travel. Without them, Corridor entry and exit is either impossible or catastrophically unsafe.

#### **Purpose and Function**

- Gates create a **stable entry or exit point** into a Corridor by anchoring it in place and supplying vast amounts of power to maintain the connection.
    
- Without a gate, Corridors remain **unusable** for most vessels. Entry leads to uncontrolled, often fatal results.
    
- Gates are located near colonies, stations, or key sectors and are crucial for maintaining **transport, communication, and supply lines**.
    

#### **Construction and Limitations**

- Building a gate is a **massive logistical effort** requiring specialized equipment, a stable orbit or staging point, and long-term maintenance infrastructure.
    
- Once constructed, **gates cannot be moved** under their own power. However, they **can be relocated short distances** with auxiliary tug fleets if a Corridor shifts within the same system.
    
- If a Corridor shifts **out of range**, the gate becomes effectively useless unless it later returns nearby.
    
- Gates may be **repaired and reactivated** if a Corridor shifts back into a reachable area, but alignment is never exact and always requires re-positioning.
    

#### **Failure and Risk**

- If a gate’s power fails or control systems destabilize, the Corridor may **collapse** or **shift prematurely**, posing catastrophic risk to ships in transit.
    
- Older gates, especially those built during humanity’s rapid expansion period, are more prone to **malfunctions and radiation leakage**.
    
- Gates at dead routes—where Corridors have collapsed or shifted irreversibly—are often left to **float abandoned**, unusable but too expensive to dismantle.
    

#### **Decontamination**

- Operational gates include **decontamination infrastructure** for handling **[[Corridor Radiation]]** exposure:
    
    - Hull cleansing systems
        
    - Crew medical screening and quarantine zones
        
    - Radiation scrubbing for key components
        
- Only ships passing through a **gated exit** receive full decontamination—those using natural or emergency exits risk spreading contamination or dying from exposure.
    

#### **Strategic Value**

- Gates are among the most **valuable and contested infrastructure** in human space.
    
- Their control determines **who lives, who starves, and who remains connected** to the rest of humanity.
    
- Many derelict or decaying colonies still maintain minimal personnel around gate structures, hoping for a Corridor to shift back into range.
