Human colonies are scattered across dozens of star systems, founded during the peak of interstellar expansion when [[Corridors]] were stable and [[Gates]] were plentiful. Their survival now depends heavily on whether their Corridor routes remain active.
They generally sustain a population of anywhere between 50-250, but rarely more due to resource strain. Unfortunately; this means that almost no colony has the population size to sustainably reproduce on its own if left isolated.
#### **Structure and Environment**

- Colonies are almost always **enclosed**, industrial, and highly functional—prioritizing longevity and utility over comfort.
    
- Most are built into **hardened structures** on planetary surfaces, inside asteroids, or within artificial stations. Windows are rare, aesthetics rarer.
    
- Life is **cramped and resource-regulated**. Colonies rely on strict maintenance cycles, rationed supplies, and relentless work routines to stay viable.
    
- Atmospheric and gravity systems vary—some use planetary conditions, others rely on artificial life support.
    

#### **Population and Culture**

- Most colonies are populated by a mix of **laborers, engineers, security forces, and administrators**.
    
- Civilian life revolves around **survival, utility work, and maintaining infrastructure**. Entertainment and culture exist but are minimal and usually improvised.
    
- Some colonies still express **loyalty to Earth**, while others have drifted into **pragmatic isolation** or outright **de facto independence**.
    
- Colonists tend to be **resilient, blunt, and practical**, shaped by generations of hardship and self-reliance.
    

#### **Supply and Isolation**

- Colonies require **supplies, information, and personnel** from other systems to remain sustainable.
    
- If a Corridor **shifts or collapses**, a colony can be **cut off indefinitely**, losing all contact with the wider network.
    
    - If the Corridor returns, it often does so too late—many such colonies are found **dead or nearly so**.
        
    - **Reclaimed colonies** are sometimes resettled or salvaged, with remnants of the previous population still present—sometimes alive, usually not.
        

#### **Quarantine and Hazards**

- Disease, resource collapse, environmental breach, and structural decay are common risks.
    
- Some colonies enact **quarantine procedures** during incidents, though enforcement varies.
    
- Rumors of **"ghost colonies"** persist—places that went dark and were later found abandoned, their interiors intact, but with no sign of where the inhabitants went.
    

#### **Strategic Role**

- Colonies extract raw materials, grow food, generate energy, or manage relay infrastructure essential to human survival.
    
- Each one is a **node** in a fraying web, propped up by ship crews and corridor routes that grow less reliable every year.
