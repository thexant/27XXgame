**Outposts** are small, often isolated installations that serve as utility points throughout human space. Unlike colonies, they are not intended for long-term habitation or large populations. Most are staffed by fewer than a dozen personnel at any given time—if at all. Many outposts operate unmanned, visited only when ships dock to refuel, repair, or drop off rotating maintenance crews. Their functions vary widely: some monitor junction systems with multiple corridor links, others serve as rest stops, emergency shelters, or orbital watchpoints for military or survey activity. A few are embedded into asteroids for resource sampling or data relay.

Outposts are typically built by nearby colonies or by central government agencies and powered by solar panels and battery systems. Supplies are delivered intermittently by ship, making them dependent on external support. While rarely intentionally abandoned, many outposts fall off the official registry once their purpose fades or routes shift, leaving them vulnerable to decay or reappropriation by scavengers and pirates. Most threats they face are environmental—systemic failures, radiation exposure, or natural hazards—but remote locations sometimes attract hostile attention. Life at an outpost, for those who live there, is routine shift work: lonely, quiet, and largely thankless.
