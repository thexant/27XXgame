Space stations serve as larger, more developed variants of outposts—functional hubs positioned primarily in orbit or deep space, often near corridor gates. Unlike colonies, they typically lack permanent civilian populations and instead operate with rotating crews of 12 to 25 workers, plus the transient presence of visiting ship crews. Their roles vary: some function as refueling or trade posts, others as military installations, research platforms, or regional relay points for logistics and communication.

Ownership is usually centralized, with the core government overseeing most stations, though some may be administered by local colonies depending on their region and purpose. Their locations are strategically chosen, especially around corridor entries and exits, where they act as critical “first stops” for arriving vessels.

Space stations are not self-sufficient. They rely heavily on external supply runs and consistent maintenance to remain operational, though with proper care they are built to endure for decades. Accessibility ranges from open ports to heavily restricted facilities depending on the station’s purpose. While life aboard a station is utilitarian and often monotonous, crews may include a mix of maintenance personnel, engineers, medical staff, shopkeepers, scientists, and security, reflecting the station’s specific needs.
