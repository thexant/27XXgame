Pirates and bandits exist on the margins of human space, surviving in the gaps left by failing infrastructure, fading oversight, and the slow decay of interstellar connectivity. Their structure ranges from single-ship operations with desperate crews to loosely organized factions flying under self-declared banners of independence—though most lack recognized territory and rarely hold captured colonies for long before they're dismantled by central authority.

Their ships are as varied as their motives: repurposed industrial freighters, stolen civilian craft, gutted mining rigs retrofitted with weapon mounts, or even old military hulls held together by luck and stolen parts. Some strike out of desperation, others for profit, and a few under ideological pretense—anti-government, separatist, or anarchist. Most, however, simply want to survive, and their targets reflect that.

They prey on the weak and the isolated: drifting vessels mid-corridor, colonies left out of rotation too long, outposts with minimal defenses. Functioning gates are rarely targeted, not out of mercy, but because disrupting a gate disrupts their own routes just as badly. Stolen cargo is either used, sold on black markets, or held for ransom. Fuel, food, and munitions are scrounged from ambushes or traded in shadowy backrooms of fringe colonies that look the other way.

To the average colonist, pirates are a terrifying unknown. To experienced ship crews, they’re more of a wildcard—some encounters end in tense stand-offs, others in blood. They’re not everywhere, but they’re common enough that no vessel travels without at least one mounted weapon and a crew ready to use it.
