Interstellar ships form the backbone of humanity’s crumbling infrastructure, ferrying people, supplies, and information between scattered [[Colonies]] via the unstable [[Corridors]] network. Their crews are often the only thread connecting humanity’s fractured outposts.

#### **Ship Types**

- Ships vary from **small haulers and corvettes** to **large freighters and carrier-class transports**, though all are built for **function over form**.
    
- Civilian ships are modular, refitted constantly, and often **patchwork relics** of older designs.
    
- Military, paramilitary, and corporate vessels also exist, though even these tend to be **underpowered, overused, and stretched thin**.
    

#### **Corridor Travel**

- Ships must enter and exit Corridors via **[[Gates]]**, which stabilize the journey and reduce the risk of catastrophic failure.
    
- While in transit, ships are exposed to **[[Corridor Radiation]]**, requiring robust hull shielding and **post-travel decontamination** procedures.
    
- Internal systems often suffer malfunctions during transit—**crew intervention is mandatory** for repairs, calibration, and maintaining life support.
    

#### **Crew Roles**

A typical crew is lean but skilled. Roles often include:

- **Navigator/Pilot** – Plots transit routes and handles gate alignments.
    
- **Mechanic/Engineer** – Maintains ship integrity, handles emergency repairs, and monitors life support.
    
- **Medical Officer** – Treats injuries and monitors radiation exposure.
    
- **Cargo/Systems Officer** – Manages supplies, ballast, and power distribution.
    
- **Captain/Commander** – Makes route decisions, enforces priorities, and often negotiates at each stop.
    

Smaller ships may consolidate roles; larger ones may have redundancy or entire teams.

#### **Life Onboard**

- Life aboard ship is **tense, exhausting, and dangerous**. Crew members live in close quarters, share limited amenities, and face **constant equipment degradation**.
    
- Crews often operate under **tight contracts** from colonial governments, Earth authorities, or corporate sponsors—but many run independent.
    
- **Salvage**, courier runs, emergency resupply, or medical retrievals are common assignments. Not all of them are above-board.
    

#### **Reputation and Culture**

- Ship crews are respected and pitied in equal measure. Their work keeps the system functioning, but at significant personal cost.
    
- They’re often **superstitious**, especially about routes that have gone “dark” before, gates with a history of failure, or ships that returned… altered.
    
- Crews trade stories, warnings, and unofficial maps wherever they dock—**information is often more valuable than money**.
    

#### **Risk and Reward**

- Every run carries the risk of **Corridor collapse, radiation overexposure, piracy, or mechanical failure**.
    
- But for many, a ship job is **the only chance at movement, purpose, or upward mobility**.
    
- Veteran crews rarely retire. Most either vanish, get stuck planetside after a failed job, or become permanent fixtures in the darker corners of a colony bar.
