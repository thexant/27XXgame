By the late 27th century, humanity has spread across the galaxy, connected not by mastery of physics but by partial understanding and exploitation of natural faster-than-light phenomena called **Corridors**. These Corridors are not artificial constructs; they are unpredictable, unstable regions of space that allow for FTL travel between distant star systems. They enabled a golden age of expansion that humanity was never fully prepared to maintain.

#### **Corridors and Gates**

Corridors link a set of spatial “positions”, loosely consistent regions within specific solar systems. These links are not stable; each Corridor **shifts between 8 to 12 general positions**, and the exact timing and order of shifts is not reliably predictable. The positions are not precise: when a Corridor shifts back to a known location, it never returns to the exact same coordinates. It re-emerges _somewhere in the general area_, often within the same system but in a slightly (or significantly) different spot. As a result, even if a gate already exists from a prior shift, it almost always must be **physically moved** to re-align with the new endpoint.

During humanity’s expansion, massive **gates** were constructed in orbit to hold Corridors open at useful locations. These megastructures stabilize a Corridor endpoint, keeping it open and usable. Moving a gate is difficult, slow, and expensive, but possible; generally requiring heavy-tug vessels over the course of weeks or months. Many gates have been rendered useless after Corridor shifts, floating aimlessly in space until reactivated or salvaged. When a Corridor reappears in a system, existing gates can sometimes be repaired and repurposed, assuming they haven't been lost, scavenged, or too badly damaged in the intervening time.

#### **Shifts vs. Collapses**

Corridors exhibit two behaviors: **shifting** and **collapsing**, which are distinct.

- A **shift** means the Corridor moves from one known position to another within its existing cycle of 8–12 regions. The move is unpredictable in timing but constrained to these familiar zones.
    
- A **collapse** is when the Corridor fails entirely. This can happen mid-transit, crushing or displacing ships caught inside. After a collapse, one of the Corridor’s existing positions is **permanently lost**. The Corridor will later:
    
    - Either **reform with a new position** (replacing the one it lost), or
        
    - **Be replaced** by a completely new Corridor, linking unrelated locations elsewhere in the galaxy.
        

Corridor collapse is dangerous but common enough that crews accept it as a known risk, similar to deep-sea trawlers accepting storms or sinkings. Collapse may eject a ship into deep space, scatter wreckage, or simply destroy it. The possibility of collapse discourages casual travel, but it doesn't paralyze commerce, just raises the stakes and reinforces the need for skilled, experienced crews.

#### **Travel and Communication**

Corridor navigation is risky and maintenance-heavy. Ships rely on **beacon signals** emitted by gates, which can only be received _within the Corridor itself_. Outside of transit, navigators rely on cached data that may be outdated. Once inside a Corridor, ships can determine whether the destination gate is still active. If the signal drops or if the Corridor collapses mid-transit, ships may attempt to reroute to a different gate if any other known exits remain viable. If not, the crew is likely lost.

Due to distance and the lack of FTL communication, **information must travel physically** between systems. Within a solar system, normal EM-based communication (radio, microwave, laser) functions with relatively minimal delay, so planets and stations can stay in touch. But between stars, only ship-based couriering works. This means politics, science, and news all move unevenly across the human sphere. There is no centralized flow of knowledge; only a scattered, delayed patchwork of partial understanding.

#### **Colonial Life**

Human colonies vary in form and function, but most are harsh, enclosed, and industrial. A typical colony might be focused on mining, energy generation, agriculture, or heavy manufacturing. These are not gleaming utopias; they’re cramped, utilitarian structures built for longevity, not comfort. Many have no windows at all. Aesthetic concerns are secondary to survival, pressurization, and efficiency. Atmospheric conditions, resource extraction needs, and environmental hazards dictate architecture.

Colonies are rarely self-sufficient. They rely on regular deliveries of parts, food, medicine, and people. When a Corridor shift or collapse cuts them off, they may last months or decades, but most degrade slowly without external support. Some endure long enough to be reconnected later, others die out. **Failed colonies are rarely abandoned forever**. If a Corridor reopens to a previously-inaccessible system, it's common for new settlers, salvage crews, or squatters to move in and repurpose the remains. Living in an old, failed colony is not considered unusual. The haunted atmosphere is simply part of life.

Even functioning colonies operate under the constant pressure of contingency. Resource scarcity is normal. Security forces, whether government-controlled or private, exist to protect infrastructure more than people. Cultural development is minimal; art, entertainment, and tradition are byproducts of coping, not priority. Celebrities, if they exist, are more like legendary crew captains or frontier heroes than actors or pop stars. Most people just want stability, survival, and a slightly better job in a slightly better place.

#### **Earth and Governance**

Earth still exists but is a hollowed-out symbol more than a power. Centuries of overuse, industrial exploitation, and political decay have rendered the planet nearly uninhabitable to large populations. It supports a small civilian base and a shrinking bureaucratic core. It survives only through imports from colonies, yet its ability to govern or support those colonies is minimal. Some colonies remain loyal out of habit or necessity; others are functionally independent. Earth’s influence now functions more like inertia than active control.

No galaxy-spanning empire or unified opposition exists. Human space is defined by loose regional zones, competing interests, and a shared dependence on unstable infrastructure. Pirates, smugglers, and privateers operate in the margins, but the greatest threat is simply the system breaking down under its own weight.

#### **Tone and Themes**

The setting emphasizes **slow decay, uncertainty, and long-term fragility**. Humanity is not doomed, but it is scattered, overextended, and reliant on forces it doesn’t fully understand or control. Most people don’t believe extinction is imminent. They live day to day, fix what breaks, and assume someone else is keeping the larger system running.

There’s no grand war, no ancient evil, no rogue AI. The only antagonist is entropy, distance, and human short-sightedness. Corridors still function... for now. Gates can be moved. Routes can be rebuilt. But every decade brings more gaps, more silence, and more ghost stations. The future of humanity is neither bright nor extinguished, just uncertain, stretched thin across stars they were never meant to hold.
