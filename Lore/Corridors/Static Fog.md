A rare but serious natural hazard, **Static Fog** is an electro-magnetic storm system formed as a byproduct of [[Corridors]] activity. It’s most often found inside active Corridors or lingering in systems that house Corridor exits, gated or not. Though not common, it’s well-documented enough to be considered a known risk—like sailing through hurricane-prone waters.

Fog drifts silently, often trackable by long-range EM readings. Ships and colonies keep alert systems tuned for it, but localized Fogs can still form suddenly and without warning. If one sweeps over a vessel or outpost unprepared, the results can be catastrophic.

In milder forms, Static Fog disables sensors, communications, nav systems, artificial gravity, or secondary electronics. Severe instances are strong enough to fry ship cores, rupture hulls through sudden magnetic shearing, or fully disable life support. Temporary depressurization, fires from electrical surge, and navigation loss mid-Corridor are all recorded outcomes.

Despite the danger, it doesn’t directly harm living tissue like Corridor Radiation. In fact, survivors often describe the Fog as eerie—silent, with the lights dimming and systems buckling one by one. Crews caught in a Fog have to rely on manual controls, fallback hardware, and nerves.

Ships running long service routes can expect to encounter it a few times in a standard year. The wise prepare. The unlucky improvise. And the dead float home in pieces, if they’re found at all.
