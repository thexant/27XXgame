Corridors are naturally occurring interstellar pathways that allow for faster-than-light (FTL) travel between distant systems. Humanity did not create them, only discovered and exploited them. Their inner mechanics remain poorly understood, but ships entering a corridor can traverse otherwise impossible distances in days or weeks, compared to centuries using conventional propulsion.

### Structure and Function

- Each corridor links multiple systems via a shifting set of **anchor positions**; usually 8 to 12. These are rough spatial regions within a star system, not fixed coordinates.
    
- Corridors can only be entered at one anchor and exited at another. There is no way to access their interior arbitrarily, nor to navigate freely once inside.
    
- Travel through a corridor is **the only practical method of interstellar transport**. There is no “short hop” between nearby systems unless they’re both connected by the same corridor.
    
- The corridor interior is highly hazardous, saturated with **[[Corridor Radiation]]** that degrades materials and causes rapid, severe health effects with enough exposure. Ships require hardened shielding and continual maintenance.
    
- **[[Gates]]**, human-built megastructures; stabilize corridor openings and force a fixed entry/exit position, making travel predictable and survivable. But they are not required: corridors can be used without gates, though doing so is significantly more dangerous and prone to navigation failure or fatal misalignment.
    

### Gate Usage

- Gates are powered and maintained either by [[Colonies]] or the central government. They are immense, stationary, and expensive to construct.
    
- If a corridor **shifts**, its new position may be near an existing gate but never identical, requiring the gate to be physically relocated within the system to realign with the corridor's new anchor.
    
- If a corridor **collapses**, one of its anchor positions is lost permanently. It will either:
    
    - Gain a new anchor elsewhere in the galaxy, or
        
    - Re-form entirely as a new corridor connecting different locations.
        
- Collapsed corridors are completely inert and cannot be reaccessed. Their previous gates are rendered useless unless repurposed, salvaged, or eventually reactivated if a new corridor forms in the same region.
    

### Shifting, Collapsing, and Travel Risks

- Corridor shifts are common and expected. They follow consistent but unpredictable cycles between their anchor positions.
    
- Ship crews accept corridor instability as part of the job. **Rare events** like collapse mid-transit can scatter or destroy vessels, but most consider the benefits of corridor use to outweigh the risks.
    
- Corridor collapse is not extinction-level for humanity, but it is cumulative. As routes are lost over decades and centuries, entire regions become inaccessible. Some colonies are reconnected by returning corridors. Others are cut off indefinitely.
    
- Occasionally, returning corridors reconnect to old systems where gates have drifted inactive or degraded. These can be reactivated with maintenance if the new corridor position is close enough.
    

### Interstellar Travel Limitations

- Without corridors, it is physically impossible to reach other star systems. No amount of engine power or technological improvement changes this.
    
- While some systems may appear “close,” they remain unreachable without an active corridor. There is no “just jump to the next star.”
    
- All human interstellar infrastructure is corridor-dependent. Ships, colonies, stations; everything hinges on corridor availability.
    

### FTL and In-System Travel

- Corridors do **not** exit directly at colonies. They exit wherever the anchor is located in the destination system—often far from inhabited worlds.
    
- Once a ship exits a corridor, it must **travel within the system** via sub-light propulsion. This leg can range from hours to weeks, depending on ship specs, fuel, and local infrastructure.
    
- Outposts and space stations serve as common waypoints between gates and colonies, providing fuel, repairs, and navigation support during longer treks.
    
- Most corridor-specific hazards (Corridor Radiation, Static Fog) do **not** persist in normal space. Once within a system, space behaves as expected.
    
- **[[Vacuum Bloom]]**, however, may follow ships or spread between systems via contamination. It is not exclusive to corridor zones.
