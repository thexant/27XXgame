Vacuum Bloom is a fungus-like, non-sentient lifeform adapted to deep space. It drifts through the void in faint, dust-like clouds—undetectable to most scanners and invisible to the naked eye unless someone knows exactly what they’re looking for. Its spores originate from somewhere outside known human space, but are now considered a universal threat across the [[Corridors]] network.

It passively seeks out heat and metallic nutrients, which makes [[ships]], stations, and [[colonies]] prime targets. Upon contact with a suitable surface, Vacuum Bloom latches instantly and begins rapid growth. The organism spreads like a hungry rot, embedding itself in tight spaces as it begins to grow. Visually, it resembles a fleshy, slime-mold infestation. The air around it carries a distinct, heavy stench of decay.

If detected early, the Bloom can be held back with improvised containment until proper decontamination is possible. Fire and specialized chemical agents are the most effective removal methods. Even in advanced growth stages, it can still be fully scrubbed—but by then, the damage is often irreversible. Entire vessels or habitats overtaken by unchecked Bloom are usually considered total losses.

Spores inhaled by humans cause respiratory failure and toxic shock as the organism begins growing inside the lungs. Victims often die within days, their bodies then consumed and colonized by the Bloom.

Vacuum Bloom poses no intelligent threat. It doesn’t hunt or plan. It simply drifts, attaches, and consumes—one of the many indifferent hazards of surviving between the stars.
