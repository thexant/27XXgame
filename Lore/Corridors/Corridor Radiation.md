Corridor Radiation is a persistent byproduct of interstellar transit via [[Corridors]]. It’s composed of exotic, poorly understood particulate matter that interacts aggressively with biological tissue and electronic systems. Present in **all active Corridors**, this radiation is an unavoidable hazard for any ship traveling between human settlements.

#### **Behavior & Presence**

- Always present in Corridors, **relatively consistent in density**, with occasional denser clouds that spike exposure levels.
    
- Slight increase in concentration near **older gates** due to microleak accumulation in their aging containment infrastructure.
    
- **Collapsed Corridors do not emit radiation**; once collapsed, emissions cease and the zone returns to normal space conditions.
    
- Does **not** appear near ungated exits unless a ship has recently transited through—radiation does not linger far beyond the corridor medium itself.
    

#### **Management**

- Gated exits include **automated decontamination infrastructure**, including hull scrubbers, crew scanning, and compartment isolation.
    
- Ships exiting through ungated points (usually during emergencies or reroutes) lack these systems, leading to **dangerous contamination risk** for both vessel and crew.
    
- Properly equipped ships include **in-transit shielding**, medical quarantine, and post-jump scanning procedures. These mitigate—but do not eliminate—exposure risk.
    

#### **Effects**

- **On materials and systems**:
    
    - Corrosion of exposed hull materials
        
    - Electrical instability, especially in nav and power systems
        
    - Optical sensor degradation
        
- **On humans**:
    
    - Initial symptoms within hours: nausea, disorientation, intense surface burns
        
    - Full-blown acute radiation syndrome within 24–48 hours in unshielded cases
        
    - Final stages: tissue necrosis, hemorrhaging, systemic organ failure
        
    - Death is agonizing, rapid, and considered inevitable without immediate care
